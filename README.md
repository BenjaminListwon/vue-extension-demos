# Vue Pointer Demo

This repo contains a few simple HTML files that demonstrate how to extend the capabilities of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org). They are meant to accompany [this blog post]() about the different strategies for extending Vue.

## Live Demo
I have a [live copy of the demo pages] in this repository over at my blog.

## Download & Run
You don't need to compile anything, or include an external dependencies for the code in these files to run. Simply [download]() a copy of the repository and open the `pointer-01.html` file in your browser.

You probably need to be running any of the [browsers in green](http://caniuse.com/#search=addEventListener) over here, since I'm mostly lazy about incorporating IE<=8, etc.
